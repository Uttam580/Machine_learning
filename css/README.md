CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

1. Element selector : 

The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name. 

Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

2. Class selector 

The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

3. CSS id Selector : 

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
